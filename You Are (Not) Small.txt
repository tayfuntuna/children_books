You are small.
I am not small. You are big. 
I am not big. See?
You are just like me. You are small. 
I am not small. See?
They are just like me. You are big.
You are all small!
You are all big!
Small!
Big!
SMALL!!!
BIG!!!
BOOM!
See? I am not small.
See? I am not big. 
No, you are not big. You are big and you are small.
And you are not small. You are small and you are big. 
I am hungry.
Let’s eat.
You are hairy.
