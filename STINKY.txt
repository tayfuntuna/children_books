I love the slimy slugs.
Hello.

And I love the stinky smell!
STINK
SNIFF AHHHH…
Shhh…
We have to very quiet.
Because on the other side of the swamp…
…is a town!
Towns have kids…
…and kids don’t like swamps. They like to take baths!
GRR!
STINKY
It makes me SO mad!
GRR!
Kids don’t like mucky mud, slimy slugs or smelly monsters like me!
The eat cake and apples. Yuck!
I stay far away from them!

GRR! GRR! GRR! GRR!
STINKY

WARTBELLY 
STINKY
CHOMP! CHOMP!
Kids don’t like gross stuff…
…and YOU are the grossest, smelliest toad in the swamp!
CROAK?
Quick! The kid is away!
Get up there, Wartbelly.
OOF

STINKY
HEE! HEE! HEE!
I’ll hide the hammer here, in the muckiest, smelliest spot in my swamp!
STINK
Back at the tree house…
What do you like to eat, Daisy?
CHOMP, CHOMP!
Maybe bugs?  Where can I find bugs?
HMM
HEE! HEE!
I’m back…
CROAK?
Yay! The kid is gone! My plan worked!
Daisy, I’m back!
I went to the muckiest, smelliest spot in the swamp and I got a big jar of bugs!
CROAK!
Heart
OH, NO!
And look what I found-my hammer!  How did it get out there?
Maybe this swamp has ghosts! Booo!
DINOS! 
Ghosts?!
So the kid likes toads…
…and the kid likes swamps
CHOMP! CHOMP!
What kind of a kid is that?!?
On to plan “C”!
Later…
…so that’s why my Mom and I moved out here.
DAISY
CROAK!

Thanks so much!
Don’t thank me.
Why not?
Because I kicked it there! 
Huh?
STIN
I was afraid of you because you’re a kid 1 and kids take baths!
I put my toad in your tree house, and I hid your hammer and I preteneded to be a ghost, and I kicked your hat in the pit! But then I tried to get your hat back and I FELL IN!
STINKY
And, and… I’m SO sorry!
