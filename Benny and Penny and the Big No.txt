Benny and Penny and the Big No-No
Hi, Benny.
Hush, Penny!
What are you looking at?
Mommy said there is a new KID next door.
But I can’t see anything!
Let me look!
But  there is nothing to see.
I WANT to look!
OH!  I can see!
What??
A pretty flower!
Who cares about an old flower?
I do!
I hope the new kid is a little girl.
Why?
Girls are nicer.
No, they’re not!
Girls are crybabies.  I hope it’s a boy!
(RAZZ! [Penny’s Garden])
Okay. WHERE is my pail?
I don’t know!
It was here yesterday!
Well, I didn’t take it!
WHERE IS IT!!
I don’t know!!
Why do you have to cray all the time? I was just ASKING!
SNIFF! Maybe the new kid took it.
Do you think the new kid climbed over the fence and came into our yard?
Maybe. (SNIFF!)
You can’t just TAKE stuff.
Yes.
That’s a no-no!
I still can’t see anything!
I can ! Down there!
Look, footprints!
They go all along the fence!
That’s the proof!
OOOPS!
PLOP!
BENNY!
I’m okay.
But we don’t belong in this yard.  It’s a BIG no-no!
WOW!
These footprints are big and scary.
The new kid must be a MONSTER.
No…Mommy would have told us.
Maybe she doesn’t know.
Let’s go back!
Not yet- I see my pail!
Stay there Penny!
SPLOP!
MUD! POOIE!
Benny, LOOK!  The monser is making mud pies.
Hush, Penny.  It will hear you!
Oh.
These mud pies have pretty flowers on top.
So?
FLAP! FLAP! FLAP! FLAP! 
Someone is coming!
HIDE!
FLAP! FLAP! FLAP!
Monster feet!
Hush, Penny!
FLAP! FLAP! FLAP!
I’ll go get my mud pies.
It’s a little GIRL!
Uh oh!  This one on the end is all broken!
Hey birds, get away from my pies!
Now, I will have to make a new one.
YEOW!
Sho’w in there? COME ON OUT!
SPLOP!
WAAAAA!!!
You made her cry! 
 I DONT CARE! She took my pail!
And it’s full of dirty old firt!
!

You asked for it!
SPLOP!

SPLOP!
WAAAAH!
Now, look what you did!
Come on, Penny. 
SPLOP!
Little MONSTER!
That new kid is MEAN!
…And she takes things!
I’m telling Mommy!
Benny, Look!
Your PAIL!
HUH?  What’s my pail doing here?
You took her pail!
OH NO! And we messed up all her mud pies!
We have to give back her pail!
But if we go back the little girl will throw mud at us.
I have an idea!
I’ll just toss the pail over the fence.
NO!
You might hurt her!
What is she doing?
Crying.
Again?
Hello.
We have your pail.
Give it back!
We’re sorry.
We took it by mistacke!
He thought it was his pail.
Don’t throw mud!
I’m putting you pail down right where it was.  
See?
Now, I’m backing away.
OOPS!
SPLOP!
TEE HEE!
AH, HA! HA!
It’s NOT funny!
Dumb girls!
WHAPP!!
WAAAAA!
Ha, ha! What a cry-baby!
No, he’s not!
WAA  AAA!
He’s hurt!
Oh, I’m sorry.
You can play with my pail.
I don’t want to!
And you can play in my yard.
But-
It’s not a no-no if she asks us.
But,I’m a dirty mess!
I’ll fix it.  Don’t move.
YEOW!
What did you do that for?
To get all the mud off.
Hey!  You’re right!
It’s gone!
Hi, I’m Melina.
I’m Penny.
And I’m Benny the little piggy playing in the mud.  OINK! OINK!
THE END
