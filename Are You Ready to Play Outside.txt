Gerald!
Are you ready to play outside?
Yes! Yes! Yes!
We are going to do everything today!
We are going to run!
We are going to skip!
We are going to jump!
NOTHING CAN STOP US!
Oh, no!
It is starting to rain.
It is raining.
It is pouring.
It is really pouring.
I have never seen so much rain in my life!
I DO NOT LIKE RAIN!
I am not a happy pig.

Thank you, Gerald.
But, it is still raining!
Grrrrr…

Maybe we can have fun, too….
We can try.
SPLASH!

Skip! Skip! Skip!
Jump! Jump! Jump!
I love rain!
I hope it rains all day!
Rats. 
Now I like rain–
and now the rain has stopped!
I am not a happy pig.
Do not worry, Piggie. I have a plan.
Rain!
Elephants make the best friends!
