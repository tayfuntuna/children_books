I am Tall
I am tall.
I am tall.
I am tall.
You are not tall!
I may not be tall…
POOF!
But I am not small!
I Can Go High
I can go high!
I can go high!
I cannot go high!
Why?
Because I cannot fly!
sigh…
There! Now you can fly!
Yes, now I can go very high!
I am Up
You are up!
Yes, I am up!
And you are down!
*FLAP FLAP FLAP FLAP*
Now I am up, too!
You should have stayed down!
We’ll help you up!
The End.
