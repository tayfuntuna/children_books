I think someone is looking at us.
Someone is looking at us!
Who is looking at us?
A monster?
No.
It is…
a reader!
A reader is reading us!
How is a reader reading us?
The reader is reading these word bubbles!
We are in a book!
We are in a book?
THAT IS SO COOL!
WE ARE IN A BOOK!

WE ARE BEING READ!

Oh!
I have a good idea!
I can make the reader say a word!
You can make the reader say a word?
I can.
If the reader reads out loud.
That is a good idea!

“Banana.”
So funny!
Do you want a turn
before the book ends?
ENDS!?!
The book ends?!
Yes.
All books end.
WHEN WILL THE BOOK END!?!
Page 57.
Page 57!
It is page 46 now!
EEK!

This book is going too fast!
I have more to give!
More words!
More jokes!
More “bananas”!
I just want to be read.
I have a good idea!
