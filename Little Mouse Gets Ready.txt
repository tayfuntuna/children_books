Little Mouse!
Yes, Mama?
I’m going to the barn with your brothers and sisters. Are you ready to go?
Almost, Mama!
Well, go and get ready!
I’ll be quick, Mama!
Oh boy, I love going to the barn!
Yes sir! There are LOTS of places to run and hide in the barn!
Now, let’s see… The first thing to put on are the underpants. 
Check for the tag. That’s the back.
Underpants are EASY to put on…
Just be sure to get your tail in the tail hole!
I can’t wait to see the chickens in the barn.
They drop lots of yummy seeds on the ground.
Then I’ll find the horses and eat all the OATS that they drop on the floor!
There!
Pants are NEXT!
I have to sit down to put my pants on.
Snapping pants isn’t TOO hard.
DID IT!
Little Mouse! Are you ready YET?
Almost, Mama!
If we’re GOOD, Mama will let us swim in the cow’s water!
Almost ready…
Right foot, DONE!
Left foot, DONE!
The shirt is last…Sometimes it’s hard to get my arm in the sleeve.
Now I line the buttons up to the holes…
It’s tricky to push the button through…
RRR!
…the button is too big for the hole!
Whew!
Just one more button, and I’ll be READY!
One…
more…
button…
Mm!
THERE!
I did it!
I’m READY!
LITTLE MOUSE? Are you ready to go?
YES, Mama!
Why, Little Mouse! WHAT are you doing?
What do you mean, Mama?
Well…
mice don’t wear clothes!
What a silly little mouse!
THE END
BYE!
