Why are you sitting in a box?
It’s not a box.
What are you doing on top of that box?
It’s not a box!
Why are you squirting a box?
I said, it’s not a box.
Now you’re wearing a box?
This is not a box.
Are you still standing around in that box?
It’s NOT NOT NOT NOT a box!
Well, what is it then?
It’s my Not-a-Box!
