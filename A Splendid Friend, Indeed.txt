What are you doing?
Are you reading?
I like to read.
Do you want to hear me read?
Now what are you doing?
Writing?
I like to write.
Do you want to see me write?
What are you doing now?
Thinking?
Thinking makes me hungry.
Are you hungry?
I think I’ll go make a snack.
I’m back.
I made a snack.
I wrote a note.
I’ll read it to you.
I like you.
Indeed I do.
You are my splendid friend.
Thank you.
I like you, too.
Indeed, I do.
You are my splendid friend.
My splendid friend, indeed.
