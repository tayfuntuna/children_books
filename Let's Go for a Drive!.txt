Piggie!
I have a great idea!
Let’s go for a drive!
That sounds fun!
Drive! Drive! Drivey-drive-drive!
WAIT!
If we are going on a drive—
we need a plan!
A plan?
First, we need a map.
I have a map!
GET THAT MAP!
You cannot go for a drive without a map!
I have the map!
Drive! Drive! Drivey-drive-drive!
Map! Map! Mappy-map-map!
WAIT!
It might be sunny while we drive.
We need sunglasses!
I have sunglasses!
GET THOSE SUNGLASSES!
Bringing sunglasses on a drive is smart planning.
I have the sunglasses!
Drive! Drive! Drivey-drive-drive!
Sunglasses! Sunglasses! Sunny-sunglasses!
WAIT!
It might rain while we drive.
We need umbrellas!
I have umbrellas!
GET THOSE UMBRELLAS!
Make a plan and stick to it, is what I say.
I have the umbrellas!
Drive! Drive! Drivey-drive-drive!
Umbrellas! Umbrellas! Umbrelly-umbrellas!
WAIT!
We have so much stuff to pack!
We need bags!
I have bags!
GET THOSE BAGS!
You cannot go wrong with a good plan.
Oof!
I have the bags!
Drive! Drive! Drivey-drive-drive!
Bags! Bags! Baggy-bag-bags!
WAIT!
There will be a lot of driving on our drive.
WE NEED A CAR!
I said, “WE NEED A CAR!”
Um…Do you have a car, Piggie?
No.
I am a pig.
A pig with a car would be silly.
Do you have a car?
I do not have a car.
OH NO!
We have everything we need for our drive…
…except a car!
Our plans are ruined.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW!?!
We could play “Pirate.”
Who needs plans when you have a pig for a pal?
Arrrrrgh!
