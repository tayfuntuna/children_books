Chapter 1
The Hottest Day 
“I was never so hot in my whole life,” said Amanda.
“My nose is hot. My knees are hot. Even my hair ribbons are hot.
“Can we go swimming?”
“Not today,” said Mother. “Maybe a glass of water would help.”
Amanda drank a glad of water.
“I’m still hot,” she said. “Maybe some lemonade would help.”
“Okay,” said Mother.
Amanda drank a glass of lemonade.
“Oops!” she said.
She spilled a little on her shorts.
“Now I’m hot and sticky,” she said. “Maybe something very cold would help. Can I have an ice pop?”
“All right,” said Mother.
Amanda picked grape, her favorite.
“Uh-oh,” she said.
The ice pop was melting faster than she could eat it.
It dripped down her chin.
It dripped down her elbows.
It dripped all over her shirt.
“Now I’m hot and sticky and drippy!” she cried.
Mother cleaned her up.
“Why don’t you go outside and see what Father is doing?” she said.
It was even hotter outside with the sun shining down.
Father was in the garden.
“Why are you wearing that funny hat?” asked Amanda.
“To keep my head cool,” said Father. “But I can’t keep the garden cool. Look at our tomatoes. Look at our string beans. Look at our squash and cucumbers.”
“They are all droopy,” said Amanda. “Just like me. I am hot and sticky and drippy and droopy.”
“I have an idea,” said Father.
“Close your eyes and I will give you a hot-day surprise.”
“That’s a poem!” said Amanda.
Amanda stood next to the cucumbers.
She closed her eyes.
She could feel the dun burning down.
She was getting hotter and hotter.
Any minute she would melt.
“Father!” she called. “Where are you?”
“Right here,” said Father. “Are you ready?”
“Yes,” said Amanda.
All of a sudden it was raining. 
Cool, wet, wonderful rain!
How could that be?
“You can open your eyes now,” said Father.
“You watered me,” said Amanda.
“Yes,” said Father.
“Now I’m not hot and sticky and drippy and droopy,” said Amanda. “I am cool.”
“Me too,” said Father.
Chapter 2
Oliver’s Fort
Oliver and his friends were building a fort in the backyard.
“Can I help?” asked Amanda.
“No,” said Oliver.
“No girls allowed,” said Albert.
“Go away,” said James.
Amanda went away.
But not too far.
She listened.
“We need some rope,” said Albert.
“You can use my jump rope,” said Amanda.
“We told you to go away,” said Oliver.
“We told you no girls allowed,” said Albert.
“And no little kids, either,” said James.
“I’m not a little kid,” said Amanda.
She went away. 
But not too far.
She watched.
“Are you spying, Amanda?” called Oliver.
“You know what we do to spies,” said Albert.
“Specially little kid girl spies,” said James.
Amanda went inside.
“Oliver is mean,” she said. “He won’t let me help build his fort.”
“Oliver is building a fort?” said Mother. “On such a hot day? How silly. Today is a day to sit in the shade and do nothing. Maybe Lollipop would like to come over.”
Amanda called Lollipop.
“It’s too hot to play,” said Lollipop.
“We won’t play,” said Amanda. “We will sit in the shade and do nothing.”
Amanda and Lollipop sat in the shade of the apple tree and did nothing at all.
After a while they had some lemonade.
“It’s a tea party,” said Lollipop.
Then they did nothing some more.
“This is fun,” said Lollipop.
“And cool,” said Amanda.
“I’m so hot!” said Oliver. “Building a fort is hard work.”
“We need a drink,” said Albert.
“Quick,” said James, “give us some lemonade!”
“You can’t have our lemonade,” said Amanda.
“Please?” said Oliver.
“No,” said Lollipop.
“No boys allowed under the apple tree,” said Amanda. “And no big kids.”
“You’re mean,” said Oliver.
“I know,” said Amanda. “But you were mean first.”
“Really really mean,” said Lollipop.
“Maybe,” said Amanda, “we might give you some if you let us see your fort.”
Oliver looked at Albert.
Albert looked at James.
“I’m so thirsty,” said James, “I could drink a whole ocean.”
“Okay,” said Oliver. “You can come see our fort, but you can’t help build it.”
“Who wants to help build it?” said Lollipop. “It’s too hot.”
So Amanda and Lollipop and Oliver and James all had lemonade in Oliver’s fort.
Chapter 3
The Lemonade Stand
“Everyone wants lemonade on such a hot day,” said Amanda.
“Let’s have a lemonade stand.”
“Yes!” said Lollipop.
So they took Amanda’s little table and a pitcher of lemonade and sat beside the road.
“I bet we’ll sell lots and lots of lemonade,” said Amanda.
“And make lots and lots of money,” said Lollipop. “I could buy Tracy the Talking, Walking Doll.”
“I could buy a new purple bike,” said Amanda.
They waited for everyone to come and buy lemonade.
But no one came.
“Maybe it’s too hot,” said Amanda. “Maybe everyone is sitting in the shade doing nothing.”
“I’m too hot,” said Lollipop. “I need a drink.”
They both had a drink of lemonade.
They waited some more.
“Hello, Amanda! Isn’t this a hot day?” 
It was Mrs. Clara Pig from next door.
“Would you like to buy some lemonade?” asked Amanda and Lollipop.
“Maybe later,” said Mrs. Clara Pig. “Now I have to put away my groceries.”
Amanda and Lollipop had another drink of lemonade. 
They waited some more.
“Oh boy, lemonade! Let me at it!”
It was William and Sam and Spencer from their class at school.
“You have to pay us,” said Lollipop.
“But we don’t have any money,” said William.
“Sorry,” said Amanda. 
The boys rode away.
“Business is bad,” said Amanda. “Now I’ll never get my new purple bike.”
They had some more lemonade.
“Hi, sweetie! Hi, Amanda!” 
It was Lollipop’s mother and her baby sister, Lulu.
“Two cups of lemonade, please,” she said.
Amanda picked up the pitcher.
“Uh-oh,” she said. “We drank it all.” 
“No one came,” said Lollipop. “And we got thirsty.”
“Lem-ade!” cried Lulu. “Want lem-ade! 
“I’ll have some, too,” said Mrs. Clara Pig.
“We’ve got money now,” said William and Sam and Spencer.
“Give us three cups.”
“It’s all gone,” said Amanda.
“Lem-ade! Lem-ade! Lem-ade!” wailed Lulu, jumping up and down.
“Coming right up.” 
It was Mother.
She was carrying a new pitcher of lemonade and a plate of cookies.
“Thank you!” said Amanda.
They poured lemonade for everyone.
“That was hard work,” said Lollipop.
“We didn’t make lots and lots of money,” said Amanda. “But it was fun.”
“Would you girls like a drink?” asked Mother.
“No,” said Amanda and Lollipop. “No more lemonade.”
Chapter 4
The Hottest Night
“Good night, Amanda,” said Mother.
“Good night,” said Amanda.
She tried to go to sleep.
But her pajamas were too hot.
Her quilt was too hot.
Hugging Sallie Rabbit was too hot.
“Mother!” she called.
“What is it?” asked Mother.
“It’s too hot to sleep,” said Amanda.
“I think you are right,” said Mother. “Why don’t we sit outside for a little while? Maybe we will feel a cool breeze.”
Mother and Amanda sat in the grass.
“I don’t feel a cool breeze,” said Amanda.
“No,” said Mother. “Not yet.”
“What are you doing outside?” asked Oliver.
“It’s too hot to sleep,” said Amanda. “We are waiting for a cool breeze.”
“I can’t sleep, either,” said Oliver. “I’m as hot as a fried egg. I’m as hot as toast. I’m as hot as oatmeal.”
“Move over,” said Amanda. “You’re making me hotter.”
“Oh, there you are,” said Father. “I’ve been looking everywhere.”
“We are waiting for a cool breeze,” said Oliver. “But there is no breeze at all. I’m as hot as spaghetti in a pot.”
“I’m as hot as a meatball,” said Amanda.
“Let’s not think about it,” said Father. “Let’s look at the stars instead.”
“Can you count them?” asked Mother.
Amanda tried.
“Twenty-two, twenty-three,” she said. “I give up.”
“A million billion,” said Oliver. “I’m still hot. As hot as hot chocolate.”
“Let me tell you a story,” said Father.
“Once upon a time there was a polar bear. His name was Snowball and he lived at the North Pole, where it is always cold.”
“Did he have a sister?” asked Amanda.
“Yes, he did,” said Father. “Her name was Ice Pop.” 
“That’s silly,” said Amanda.
“Every day Snowball and Icy Pop played in the snow,” said Father.
“They went sledding down ice hills and skating on ice ponds. They made snow bears and snow forts.”
“And snow angels,” said Amanda. 
“And do you know what they ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?” asked Father.
“Ice cream?” said Oliver.
“That’s right,” said Father.
“And then their mother tucked them in and Snowball and Ice Pop went to sleep in their nice, cool ice house.”
“That was a nice, cool story,” said Amanda.
“Oh my,” said Mother. 
“I think I feel it. A cool breeze.”
“I feel it, too,” said Father.
“Hooray!” said Oliver. “I’m as cool as a pool.”
“Finally,” said Amanda.
