SUPERTRUCK
The bucket truck fixes a power line. 
The firetruck puts out a blaze. 
The garbage truck?
 He just collects the trash. 
One evening, it starts snowing.
 It snows and snows and snows. 
The city is caught in a terrible blizzard. 
Just then, the garbage truck sneaks into a garage and becomes… SUPERTRUCK!
He digs out the west side.
 He digs out the east side.
 He digs out the whole city. Hooray for Supertruck!
The next morning, the trucks wonder about the mighty truck who saved them.
 Where could he be? 
He's just collecting the trash.
