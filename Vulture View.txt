The sun is rising.
Up, up.
It heats the air.
Up, up.
Wings stretch wide to catch a ride on warming air.
Going where?
Up, up!
Turkey vultures tilt, soar, scan
 to find the food that vultures can…
…eat!
That snake over there? 
No, no.
That fox over there?
No, no.
That bear over there?
No, no.
Vultures smell the air.
They sniff, search, seek 
for foods that…
…REEK!
Those fragrant flowers?
No, no.
That spicy smoke?
No, no.
That stinky dead deer?
Yes, yes!
Vultures like a mess.
They land and dine.
Rotten is fine.
They eat, then clean.
Splash! Dry. Preen.
They hop, flap, soar
to look for more.
All afternoon.
But soon…
…the sun starts to sink.
Down, down.
The air starts to cool.
Down, down.
Wings glide, wings ride
through cooling air.
Going where?
Going down, down, down!
The vultures gather in vulture trees,
settle and sleep, like families.
Until…
…the morning sun rises.
Up, up.
It heats the air.
Up, up.
Wings stretch wide
to catch a ride
on warming air.
Going where?
Up, up!
