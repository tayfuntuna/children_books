Hello, little bat.
What is your name?
My name is Bumblebee Bat.
I am small, like a bee.

My body is one inch long.
I am six inches wide
	when I spread my wings.

My fur is reddish brown.
My nose looks like a pig’s snout.
My ears are long and pointy.
My eyes are tiny specks.
Bumblebee Bat,
when do you fly?
I fly before sunrise and just after dark.
I don’t like bright sun.
Bumblebee Bat,
how do you sleep at night?
I make a squeaky sound that
 	bounces back from whatever it hits.
I see by hearing.
Bumblebee Bat,
what do you eat?
I eat small insects like moths and flies.
Bumblebee Bat,

I am afraid of humans and birds.
Humans sometimes burn the forest 
	near my home.

I sleep hanging upside down in my cave.
I hold on with the sharp claws on my feet.

Bumblebee Bat!
Bumblebee bats were discovered in western Thailand in 1973.
They are sometimes called Kitti’s hog-nosed bats.

Bumblebee bats are the smallest bats in the world.
They are as light as a dime.
Bumblebee bats are very good at flying.
They can hover in one place for a short time.
Bumblebee bats are endangered. 
This means they are very rare.
Bat scientists keep the location of the bats’ caves secret.
This keeps the bats safe.
