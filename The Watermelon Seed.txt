I love watermelon!
CHOMP! CHOMP! CHOMP!
It’s the best. 
Ever since I was a teeny, tiny baby crocodile, it’s been my favorite.
CHOMP! SLURP! CHOMP!
I like it for breakfast.
I like it for lunch.
I like a big salty slab for dinner…
and I LOVE it for dessert
I love watermelon!
Gulp.
I just swallowed a seed.
I SWALLOWED A SEED!
It’s growing in my guts!
Soon vines will come out of my ears!
My stomach will stretch!
My skin will turn pink!
I don’t want to be in a fruit salad!
SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME!
Oh no!
I can feel it growing inside me!
It’s happening right now!
My stomach feels funny….
BUUUUUURRRRRRPPP!!!
Oh.
Here’s the seed.
That was too close!
No more melon for me.
NEVER AGAIN!
Well, maybe just a teeny, tiny bite.
CHOMP! CHOMP! CHOMP!
