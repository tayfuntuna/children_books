Rover’s in the doghouse, chewing on a bone.
What a day to romp and play!
Too bad he’s all alone.
Oh, my, look at the sky!
Thunder! Lightning!
Mighty frightening!
Rain is pouring….
Oh, how boring.
Rover’s in the doghouse, sleeping through the storm….
Cat is looking all around to find a place that’s warm.
Move over, Rover!
Cat’s in the doghouse, sleeping through the storm….

Skit-scat, Cat!
Move over, Rover!
Raccoon’s in the doghouse, sleeping through the storm….

Make room, Raccoon!
Skit-scat, Cat!

Blue Jay’s looking all around to find a place that’s warm.
Squeeze in, Squirrel!

Snake is looking all around to find a place that’s warm.
Out of the way, Blue Jay!

Make room, Raccoon!
Skit-scat, Cat!

Mouse is looking all around to find a place that’s warm.
Slide aside, Snake!
Out of the way, Blue Jay!
Squeeze in, Squirrel!
Make room, Raccoon!
Skit-scat, Cat!
Move over, Rover!
Tight fit. Might split.
Sorry, Mouse. Full house!
Crowded in the doghouse, all are sleeping well.
But then…sniff, sniff!
They catch a whiff!
What’s that awful smell?
Skitter, scatter!
What’s the matter?
Scamper, scurry!
What’s the hurry?
Skunk’s in the doghouse, sleeping through the storm….
The rest are racing round to find another place that’s warm.
Oh, my, look at the sky!
Storm’s over.
Where’s Rover?
Romping?
Racing?
Jumping?
Chasing?
No!
Rover’s in the doghouse, chewing on a bone.
Soaked and sopping, tail flip-flopping, happy he’s alone!
