Chapter 1
A fly went flying.
He was looking for something to eat—
something tasty,
something slimy.
A boy went walking.
He was looking for something to catch—
something smart,
something for
The Amazing Pet Show.
They met.
The boy caught the fly in a jar.
“A pet!” he said.
The fly was mad.
He wanted to be free.
He stomped his foot
and said—
BUZZ!
The boy was surprised.
He said, “You know my name!
You are the smartest pet in the world!”
Chapter 2
Buzz took the fly home.
“This is my pet,” Buzz said to Mom and Dad.
“He is smart. He can say my name. Listen!”
Buzz opened the jar.
The fly flew out.
“Flies can’t be pets!” said Dad.
“They are pests!”
He got the fly swatter.
The fly cried—
BUZZ!
And Buzz came to the rescue.
“You are right,” said Dad.
“This fly is smart!”
“He needs a name,” said Mom.
Buzz thought for a minute.
“Fly Guy,” said Buzz.
And Fly Guy said—
BUZZ!
It was time for lunch.
Buzz gave Fly Guy something to eat.
Fly Guy was happy.
Chapter 3
(sign that reads: THE AMAZING PET SHOW)
Buzz took Fly Guy to The Amazing Pet Show.
The judges laughed.
“Flies can’t be pets,” they said.
“Flies are pests!”
Buzz was sad.
He opened the jar.
“Shoo, Fly Guy,” he said.
“Flies can’t be pets.”
But Fly Guy liked Buzz.
He had an idea.
He did some fancy flying.
The judges were amazed.
“the fly can do tricks,” they said.
“But flies can’t be pets.”
They Fly Guy said—
BUZZ!
The judges were more amazed.
“The fly knows the boy’s name,” they said.
“But flies can’t be pets.”
Fly Guy flew high, high, high into the sky!
Then he dived down, down, down into the jar.
“The fly knows his jar!” the judges said.
“This fly is a pet!”
So they let Fly Guy in the show.
He even won an award.                 (see page)
And so began a beautiful friendship.
