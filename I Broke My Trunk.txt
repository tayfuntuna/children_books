I have not seen Gerald today.
Why?
Gerald!
What happened to your trunk?
I broke my trunk.
How did you break your trunk?
It is a long, crazy story.
Tell it!
Tell it!
Well…
I was playing with Hippo.
Then, I had an idea! 
I wanted to lift Hippo onto my trunk!
Why?
Because!
Okay.
So, I lifted Hippo onto my trunk.
But, a hippo on your trunk is heavy.
Is that how you broke your trunk?
No.
There is more to my story.
Then, Rhino showed up….
Rhino wanted a turn.
What did you do?
I lifted both of them onto my trunk!
But, a hippo and a rhino on your trunk are very heavy.
Is that how you broke your trunk? 
No.
There is more to my story.
Then Hippo’s sister showed up!
Hippo has a sister?
A big sister…
Did she want a turn, too?
Yes.
She also wanted to play her piano.
Two hippos, one rhino, and a piano on your trunk are very, very heavy.
Is that how you broke your trunk?!
No.
This is a long, crazy story….
Gerald?
HOW DID YOU BREAK YOUR TRUNK!?!
Well, I was so proud of what I had done…
that I ran to tell my very best friend about it!
But, I tripped and fell…
WHOOP!
…and broke my trunk.
You broke your trunk running to tell me your story?
That is a crazy story!
That is a funny story!
I want to tell someone your crazy story!
Piggie!
What happened to your snout?!
It is a long, crazy story….
